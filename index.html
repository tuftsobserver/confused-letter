        <p>Dear Newsfeed,</p>
        <div class="center-art">
          <img id="feed" src="img/lines.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t too forward, but I&rsquo;ve been checking you out a lot lately. At least two to three times before 3 p.m. and like, eight times after dinner. Sometimes, I&rsquo;ll even go to certain places in the Campus Center because they have better wifi, so I know I&rsquo;ll be able to reach you faster. I downloaded you on my phone so I can spend more time with you. I desperately await each new update or notification. I&rsquo;ll admit it, I&rsquo;m addicted.</p>
        <p>It wasn&rsquo;t always this way. I remember, way back when, I&rsquo;d sneak a peek at you two, maybe three times a day. It was nice, non-committal. I liked what I saw. You gave me the headlines I needed to know, the updates I kind of wanted, and the social validation I needed. You were a nice new addition to my life, a good source of information, a connection to a larger community. How else would I be able to stay up to date on the messed up shit that goes on in the Tufts 2019 page if it weren&rsquo;t for you, Newsfeed?</p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly when things started to change, but I think I can trace it back to one thing: election season. Things started innocently enough, a few posts about Hillary, a joke or two about how stupid it would be if Donald Trump actually secured the Republican nomination. I was intrigued, sure, but I kept my distance from you. I didn&rsquo;t post anything, I threw in a like or two occasionally. I was being smart, I thought. I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be healthy to jump into things too quickly. I&rsquo;ve been burned before; I wanted to protect my heart.</p>
        <div class="center-art">

        </div>
        <p>But then Bernie Sanders came into the picture. At first, Newsfeed, I thought you were posting photos of my Grandpa and accidentally tagging him as another old White man. It wasn&rsquo;t until I watched a five-second video clip that I realized this man was not my grandfather, but was in fact a real live politician. This guy was real, trashing Wall Street and late-stage capitalism with a good-natured Brooklyn accent and unkempt hair that screamed, &ldquo;I am a socialist!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The people were #feelingthebern and I was #feelingyou, Newsfeed. You were giving me exactly what I wanted and I was eating it up. I know, I know, things weren&rsquo;t perfect. That Bernie quote you posted about how Syria was just &ldquo;a quagmire within a quagmire&rdquo; did, admittedly, make me a little nervous, but by then it was too late. With every new anti-capitalist Bernie meme, Sarah Silverman commercial, or New York reference, you pulled me in deeper and deeper until I became lost in a blissful wonderland, full of promise and political revolution.</p>
        <p>...I should&rsquo;ve known it could never last.</p>
        <p>As Bernie lost his spark, so did we. What happened to us? Where did that fire, that passion we had during the primaries go? And, most importantly, why aren&rsquo;t we talking about it? And don&rsquo;t you dare try to play dumb by notifying me of another &ldquo;friendship anniversary&rdquo; or introducing a new &ldquo;like&rdquo; button, because when you strip away all of that you can see our relationship for what it truly is: a shell of its former self.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s just frustrating, honestly. I don&rsquo;t even know why I&rsquo;m still in this relationship at this point. I give and give my time to you constantly, and what do I get in return? The same sexist Hillary posts and ignorant statements by sad, confused White people who refuse to acknowledge their privilege. Just when I log on thinking you&rsquo;re going to give me something good, I just read the same, reproduced shit with a slightly different Trump quote that makes my ovaries want to shrivel and die.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m tired, Newsfeed. I&rsquo;m tired of the way things are going and I&rsquo;m tired of the way you&rsquo;ve been treating me. I deserve the same respect that Donald Trump gives to cis-White heterosexual males who also happen to be billionaires. No, scratch that, I want more than respect. I want to be courted, wooed. I want to be pursued like those big Wall Street donors that Hillary goes after. And if you can&rsquo;t do that? Well, there&rsquo;s only about a month away from Election Day. If I don&rsquo;t see you trying to make some serious improvements to this relationship by then&hellip;</p>
        <p>Instagram&rsquo;s been looking real good these days after that new update.</p>
        <p>With love (but only occasionally),</p>
        <p>Katherine Alpert Hirsch</p>
